## ðŸ§© Component Architecture (Atomic Design)

- Use **Atomic Design** principles:
  - `atoms/`: basic UI like buttons, inputs
  - `molecules/`: grouped inputs, cards
  - `organisms/`: forms, modals, complex blocks

- Use `<script setup lang="ts">` syntax
- Define props via `defineProps()` with types
- Use `defineEmits()` for events
- Expose slots with clear naming
- File name should match the component: `UserCard.vue`, `FormInput.vue`
